I'm missing some information too, and I'm hoping you could help me fill in the gaps. I want to make sure that my data is equally robust for every public official. <br><br>

Here's the information I'm still looking for:<br>
• Personal Twitter<br>
• Birth Date<br>
• Personal Instagram<br>
• LinkedIn<br>
<br>
Thank you so much for helping us build the most complete dataset possible. Please reach out with any questions, in addition to a confirmation of our existing data and filling in what we do not have.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br>

I hope this email finds you well. I'm a researcher with Govpack, an open-source technology that aggregates data on state- and local-level elected officials, allowing local newspapers to easily build candidate profiles and election guides. I'm in the process of data collection, and I wanted to make sure that I have complete, accurate data to fill out your profile.<br><br>
