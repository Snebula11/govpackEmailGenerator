I hope this email finds you well. I'm a researcher with Govpack, an open-source technology that aggregates data on state- and local-level elected officials, allowing local newspapers to easily build candidate profiles and election guides. I'm in the process of data collection, and I wanted to make sure that I have complete, accurate data to fill out your profile.<br><br>

This is the information I've collected:<br>
• Name: Thomas R. Carper<br>
• Party: Democratic Party<br>
• State: DE<br>
• Status: Incumbent<br>
• District: Delaware<br>
• Gender: Male<br>
• Office: U.S. House Delaware<br>
• Date Of Birth: 1947-01-23<br>
• Official Website: https://www.carper.senate.gov/public<br>
• Capitol Address: 513 Hart Senate Office Building<br>

• RSS: https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/?a=RSS.Feed<br>
<br>
I'm missing some information too, and I'm hoping you could help me fill in the gaps. I want to make sure that my data is equally robust for every public official. <br><br>

Here's the information I'm still looking for:<br>
• Education<br>
