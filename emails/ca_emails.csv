I hope this email finds you well. I'm a researcher with Govpack, an open-source technology that aggregates data on state- and local-level elected officials, allowing local newspapers to easily build candidate profiles and election guides. I'm in the process of data collection, and I wanted to make sure that I have complete, accurate data to fill out your profile.<br><br>
