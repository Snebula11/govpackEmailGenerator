"Richard C. Shelby,<br><br>

I hope this email finds you well. I'm a researcher with Govpack, an open-source technology that aggregates data on state- and local-level elected officials, allowing local newspapers to easily build candidate profiles and election guides. I'm in the process of data collection, and I wanted to make sure that I have complete, accurate data to fill out your profile.<br><br>

This is the information I've collected:<br>
• Name: Richard C. Shelby<br>
• Party: Republican Party<br>
• State: AL<br>
• Status: Incumbent<br>
• District: Alabama<br>
• Gender: Male<br>
• Office: U.S. House Alabama<br>
• Date Of Birth: 1934-05-06<br>
• Official Website: https://www.shelby.senate.gov<br>
• Capitol Address: 304 Russell Senate Office Building<br>
• Capitol Phone: 202-224-5744<br>
• Capitol Fax: 202-224-3416<br>

<br>
I'm missing some information too, and I'm hoping you could help me fill in the gaps. I want to make sure that my data is equally robust for every public official. <br><br>

Here's the information I'm still looking for:<br>
