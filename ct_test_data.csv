Ben,ocd-person/5d963d6d-74c1-4282-9ad4-592c3760bead,Robin E. Comey,Connecticut,"State Representative Robin Comey was elected in 2018 to serve the citizens of Connecticut’s 102nd House District in Branford.

This legislative session, Comey has been tapped to leadership positions including House Vice Chair of the Insurance and Real Estate Committee, and a member of the Education and Committee on Children.

An experienced advocate for the disabled community, Rep. Comey is currently co-chairing a Work Group Concerning Issues Affecting Deaf, Hard of Hearing and DeafBlind Persons and participating on a Community Hospice Ombudsman Workgroup. Additionally, as a Co-Chair of the Early Childhood Caucus Comey is working with NCSL and several state-wide organizations to build understanding and support among legislators on the role a strong early care system plays in the economic and family success of CT families.

A skilled coalition builder, she is dedicated to addressing issues facing Branford and Connecticut residents, from preserving the environment to advocating for policies that improve access to care and the health, safety and education of young children and their families. She is an effective leader in the legislature reaching bipartisan support and finding solutions beneficial to all state residents.  

During her first legislative session, she championed legislation to increase access to life-saving epinephrine in public places including theme parks, restaurants, day care centers, and overnight camps. Connecticut now joins 33 other states and the District of Columbia that have already passed similar legislation allowing public venues to maintain an epinephrine auto injector supply for anyone having a life-threatening allergic reaction.

Comey is a small business owner, and a non-profit leader who has worked relentlessly throughout Branford helping to improve the quality of life for residents.

She was inducted into the 2019 Branford Education Hall of Fame for her tireless efforts in improving education in Branford.

She worked, alongside other advocates, to make Branford the first school district in Connecticut to effectively institute food allergies policy and management which became the model for state-wide legislation that passed in the Spring of 2017.

Comey serves on the board of the Branford Historical Society, the East Shore District Health Department’s Community Health Improvement Project’s, and the Nurturing Family Network’s Advisory Board.

Robin is married and has a child at UConn and a child in Cooperative Arts & Humanities High School in New Haven.

Sen. Haskell attended the Westport Public Schools and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Georgetown University. Prior to serving in the State Senate, Senator Haskell interned for the Democratic National Committee, analyzing state legislation and fighting for voting rights. He also assisted the Community Tax Aid program in Washington D.C., working with low-income residents as they filed their taxes. While at Georgetown, Sen.

Ben,ocd-person/2d21e401-cb76-4001-b836-e57f667f550f,Martin M. Looney,Connecticut,"Martin Looney currently is in his fifteenth term having been elected to the State Senate in 1992. In January of 2015, Senator Looney was elected by the members of the State Senate to serve as President Pro Tempore, the highest-ranking legislator in the Connecticut General Assembly.

Prior to his election as Senate President, Senator Looney served 12 years as Senate Majority Leader. During his career he served six years as Senate Chair of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee; Chairman of the Banks Committee; and one term as Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee.

In 2011 and 2012, Senator Looney helped craft and lead passage of two bipartisan Jobs Bills aimed at helping thousands of small and medium size businesses and manufacturers in hiring, buying, training and expanding. Additionally, the 2011 and 2012 Jobs Bills provide job-training support for post-9/11 combat veterans, as well as a marketing campaign that promotes Connecticut’s wealth of cultural, educational and tourist destinations and a business incentive program that encourages companies to move jobs from overseas back to Connecticut.

In the Senate, Senator Looney has a record of supporting progressive legislation—most notably an earned income tax credit for the working poor, increases to the minimum wage, and paid family and medical leave for Connecticut’s workers.

During his tenure as State Representative, Looney was appointed an Assistant Majority Leader and served as Chairman of the Planning and Development Committee, the Government Administration and Elections Committee and the Appropriations Judicial Subcommittee, and as Vice-chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

In 1987, Senator Looney was selected as Legislator of the Year by the Caucus of Connecticut Democrats and following his first House term in 1982 he was honored by the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women for his successful work as sponsor of legislation to provide tax credit incentives to employers who create on-site day care for the children of their employees. In 1993, the Connecticut Coalition Against Gun Violence honored Senator Looney for his efforts in helping to gain passage of Connecticut's historic assault weapon ban.

Prior to his election to the General Assembly in 1980, Looney was a Public Information Aide to the Mayor of New Haven and taught English Literature and Composition as an adjunct faculty member at Quinnipiac University and the University of New Haven.

Senator Looney has been a member of the Board of Directors of the Fair Haven Community Health Center and of Community Mediation, Inc. He has also been a member of the Board of St. Rose of Lima School in New Haven and is a past parish trustee and past president of the Saint Rose Parish Council. In 1992, he was honored as the recipient of the National Catholic Elementary School Distinguished Graduate Award. In 1993, he was honored as an Alumni Knight of Honor by Notre Dame High School in West Haven.

Senator Looney is a graduate of Saint Rose School in New Haven, Notre Dame High School, and is a cum laude graduate of Fairfield University, where at commencement he was awarded Departmental Honors in English and Theology. He was selected as a National Woodrow Wilson Fellow for graduate study and earned a Master's Degree in English from the University of Connecticut.

He received his J.D. Degree in 1985 from the University of Connecticut School of Law and, since his admission to the Connecticut Bar in 1985, he has been engaged in the general practice of law. He is a partner in the law firm of Keyes & Looney. He is also a practitioner in residence with the Criminal Justice Program in the Department of Public Safety at the University of New Haven, practitioner in residence at Quinnipiac University School of Law, and is an adjunct faculty member in the Political Science Department at Quinnipiac University.

Senator Looney resides at 132 Fort Hale Road in New Haven with his wife, Ellen. Their son, Michael, an urban planner and administrator, is a graduate of Yale College who also holds a Master's Degree in Urban Planning from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Senator Looney is the proud grandfather of Matthew, Anna Katherine and Isabel Grace.","Marty Looney faced personal and political crises as 2016 wound down: A lifetime of medication for arthritis left him in need of a kidney transplant, and the 2016 election delivered him an evenly divided State Senate. He underwent a successful transplant days before Christmas, accepting an organ donated by a friend, Superior Court Judge Brian Fischer. His continued hold on being president pro tem relies on the tie-breaking vote of Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman, the Democrat who is the presiding officer of the State Senate under the Connecticut Constitution.
 
 The longtime State Senate majority leader, Looney became its top leader, the president pro tempore, on the opening day of the 2015 session. He succeeded Donald E. Williams Jr., who held the post for a decade. Looney is the longest-serving legislator in the State Senate (with a tenure split between the chambers) and a student of the General Assembly's history and traditions. He has a professorial manner, befitting someone with degrees in literature and theology, but has not lacked for political ambition.
 
 Before becoming Democratic majority leader in 2003, Looney had stints as co-chair of the banks and finance committees. In New Haven, he lost a bruising primary for the Democratic mayoral nomination in 2001 to Mayor John DeStefano. Looney's chief of staff is Vinnie Mauro, who moonlights as the Democratic town chairman of New Haven, which produces more Democratic votes than any other municipality in Connecticut. 
 
 In the State Senate, Looney has a record of supporting progressive causes and organized labor. Two of his priorities for 2017 reflect a pro-labor agenda: raising the minimum wage, which went to $10.10 on Jan. 1, 2017, to $15 in steps; and creating an employee-funded system of paid family leave.
 
 He supported mandating insurance coverage for autism therapy, the decriminalization of marijuana, the abolition of the death penalty, and allowing undocumented immigrants to attend public colleges at in-state rates. As a House member in 1991, he voted for passage of the income tax.
 
 The election of Gov. Dannel P. Malloy in 2010 as the state's first Democratic governor in 20 years gave Looney a chance to see long-sought legislation pass, most notably an earned income tax credit for the working poor that Looney had sought for more than two decades. 
 
 He and Malloy have had a profitable partnership, working together to pass laws decriminalizing small amounts of marijuana, legalizing the production and sale of marijuana for limited medical uses, twice increasing the state's minimum wage (though not in 2017), mandating that certain private employers offer paid sick days and repealing the death penalty. But a chronic fiscal crisis, driven by a slow recovery from the 2008 recession and an unfunded pension liability, have limited their ambitions.
 
 Looney lives in New Haven with his wife, Ellen.

Ben,ocd-person/0a4ae3cc-c2dc-4ef4-8ba8-95be03126a02,Peter A. Tercyak,Connecticut,"Peter Tercyak was raised in New Britain from the age of two, graduating from Holy Cross and St. Thomas Aquinas. He also attended high school in Warsaw, Poland.

Peter was first involved in health care through volunteering at the Veterans’ Hospital in Newington. With degrees from UConn and Capital Community College, he became a registered nurse and almost 30-year career has cared for thousands of patients with psychiatric and substance abuse problems. Now, he does home care nursing.

Raised with a strong belief in the importance of activism and community service, Peter has worked on campaigns to reform managed care, provide job security and crack down on the rising cost of prescription drugs. In addition, Peter worked on his father’s campaigns for the 26th House District, elections for the New Britain Board of Education, governor and many others.

Peter lives on Belridge Road in New Britain.","Peter Tercyak is a Democrat who stands to the left of Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy. He would have preferred to see more of Malloy's $1.5 billion first-year tax increase fall on the wealthy, but he gave the governor his due for pushing forward items on a progressive's wish list. In 2011, he said Malloy's budget hurt the middle class, then memorably praised him for proposing an earned-income tax credit for the working poor, which later passed.
 
 ""If a meteor were to land on his head tonight, for that alone he would go directly to heaven,"" Tercyak said in early 2011.
 
 Over the governor's first term, Tercyak found himself frequently backing and sometimes praising the governor over the repeal of the death penalty, decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana, two minimum-wage increases, and a mandate on certain private employers to provide paid sick days. He also voted for the sweeping gun-control law passed in response to the shooting deaths of 26 children and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.
 
 Tercyak is the co-chair of the Labor and Public Employees Committee. With others on the left, Tercyak is looking beyond the minimum wage as a way to close the income gap. in late 2014, he wrote an opinion piece in which he bemoaned that too many large corporations like Wal-Mart are so stingy with wages and benefits that state taxpayers in effect subsidize their employees.
 
 ""There are answers. I'm supporting a bill that would raise the hourly pay for low-wage workers at large corporations like Walmart or franchisors like McDonald's. If these companies don't up their workers' wages, then they should reimburse the state instead. The fee will be $1 per hour, per worker, payable to the state Labor Commissioner. They can easily avoid the fee by paying their employees a minimum of $11.90 per hour instead."" 
 
 Tercyak was one of four legislators to vote against a 2013 measure that closed public access to police photographs of homicides, a bill passed in the final hours of the legislative session at the request of families of those killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Tercyak became emotional after the vote as he explained it to reporters, saying that such a significant change to the state's Freedom of Information Act should have gone through lengthy consideration.
 ""Open government's the bedrock, sorry,"" Tercyak said. ""Some principles are always there, and the reason people can trust our government and police departments is because we don't have secrets.""
 
 ""It's never easy. I don't know that it's ever harder than this,"" he added. ""But that's why we do it. That's what we're about.""
 
 Tercyak is married to Patricia A. Rehmer, the former commissioner of mental health and addiction services.

She is House Chair of the Planning and Development Committee and a member of the Government Administration and Elections and Transportation Committees.

Since her election to local office in 2005 and now as a legislator, Cristin has been committed to helping her community and our state thrive: planning for and creating healthy, safe and vibrant communities, supporting economic development and diversity, improving voter access and participation, and advocating for mental health and wellness initiatives.

In Cristin' role as the Planning and Development Committee Chair, she has been integral in modernizing and re-organizing zoning statutes to provide greater clarity and tools to local planning and zoning officials, empower towns and cities to facilitate economic growth, ensure inclusive communities, add energy and environmental protections to their zoning codes, and allow accessory dwelling units across the state. Cristin spearheaded legislation that creates a state Geographic Information Systems (GIS) office and advisory council, allows access to original birth certificates for all adult adoptees, and streamlines access for outdoor dining.

As a member of the Government Administration and Elections Committee, Cristin worked with committee leadership to expand voter accessibility, restoring voting rights to those on parole, and giving the CT voters the chance to vote on two Constitutional Amendments: one for early voting and the other to provide no-excuse absentee ballots to registered voters.

Cristin’s long-term advocacy on behalf of both public transit and active transportation, and safety resulted in a requirement for the use of back seat seatbelts for all ages and a groundbreaking bill for pedestrian and bicycle safety. The bill creates the nation’s first statewide Vision Zero council and provides multiple safeguards for those who walk and bike to work, school, or pursue exercise or recreational opportunities.

As long-time co-chair of Fairfield CARES Community Coalition, Cristin has spent over a decade working on youth wellness promotion and substance misuse prevention. She is a certified QPR (Question, Persuade, Refer) suicide prevention trainer. Her past volunteer service in multiple community organizations includes scouting, church groups, and civic organizations.

Educated at the University of Notre Dame and the University of Washington in the Master of Social Work program, she and her husband, Brian are parents to three children, all of whom attend or have been through Fairfield Public Schools.","Cristin McCarthy Vahey, a Democrat, is a Pennsylvania native who came to Connecticut by way of Seattle in 2002. Her husband was taking a job in Stamford, and the couple had just four days to find a house. Their Realtor found them a home in Fairfield and introduced Vahey at the next meeting of the League of Women Voters. Vahey quickly became involved in civic life in Fairfield, successfully running for seats on the Representative Town Meeting in 2005 and the Board of Selectman in 2011.
 
 Vahey is a social worker by training, but has been a stay-at-home mother in recent years.
 
 In her first year in office, she was one of four House Democratic co-sponsors of a bill that would repeal the trigger provision of a GMO labeling law, which will not take effect until other states pass a similar law. She also co-sponsored a proposal to impose a moratorium on charter schools.
 
 McCarthy Vahey was one of 11 House Democrats to break with her leadership and the administration of Gov. Dannel P. Malloy by voting against the 2015 budget, which included tax increases that prompted her biggest hometown company, General Electric, to threaten to leave Connecticut. She was one of eight House Democrats to break ranks on the budget in 2016.

Ben,ocd-person/02ce0fa3-ac25-42dd-9f5e-ee44b7e9d542,Craig C. Fishbein,Connecticut,"State Representative Craig Fishbein was first elected to the House of Representatives during a special election to fill a vacant seat in November 2016, and was also elected to his first full term on the same day. Craig’s political principles are grounded in seeking smaller government, lower taxes, and less interference in the day-to-day affairs of our law-abiding citizens.

Representative Fishbein was named Ranking Member of the legislature’s powerful Judiciary Committee for the 2021-2022 session by House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora. Ranking members serve as a liaison to caucus members regarding the important issues from each individual committee.

He also serves on the Government Administration and Elections (GAE) Committee and the Environment Committee for the 2021-2022 session. Previously, Representative Fishbein served on the Energy and Technology, Commerce Committee, Public Safety and Security, and the Labor Committee.

Representative Fishbein attended Wallingford schools, and graduated from Mark T. Sheehan High School in 1983 before briefly attending Southern Connecticut State University.  In 1985, Representative Fishbein left school to focus on his career and successfully worked in retail management for large, national retailers for more than a decade before enrolling at Quinnipiac College to finish his degree.

In 1994, Craig returned to school, and while working as a manager at Bradlees, and then as an overnight crew manager for BJ’s Wholesale Club in Fairfield, CT, Representative Fishbein attended school full-time and completed his degree from Quinnipiac University, where he graduated cum laude with a Bachelor’s degree in marketing. Upon completion of his degree, he was offered a partial scholarship to attend the Quinnipiac University School of Law.

During law school, Representative Fishbein worked full-time as a clerk at the New Britain Superior Court, and upon graduation in 2001 passed the Connecticut Bar.  In July of 2002, Representative Fishbein joined his father, Norman, at Fishbein Law Firm, LLC, in Wallingford, where he continues to practice law primarily devoted to civil litigation in Connecticut’s state and federal courts.  In 2005, he became licensed to practice before the United States Supreme Court.

In addition to his service to the state, Representative Fishbein has been a member of the Wallingford Town Council since January of 2010, and he has consistently sought out differing opinions and engaged in hours of personal research on important issues before making a decision.  As such, he says there is hardly a decision he has made in the Town Council Chambers he would have handled differently. A proponent of small government, Representative Fishbein has never voted for a tax increase during his time on the Town Council.

In 2012, Representative Fishbein was appointed to serve on the State of Connecticut’s Board of Firearms Permit Examiners (BFPE), and served as Vice-Chairman and Secretary. Representative Fishbein resigned his positon on the BFPE before taking the oath of office for State Representative.

Craig enjoys the shooting sports, hiking, fishing, vegetable gardening, and ice hockey.  A lifelong fan of the Boston Red Sox and New York Rangers, many people say that he bleeds “Ranger Blue.” Representative Fishbein and his wife Rhonda have been married for 28 years","Fishbein won two elections for the same seat on Nov. 8, 2016: He won a special election to fill the unexpired term of Rep. Mary Fritz, who died July 9, and a full two-year term.
 
 As a town councilor, Fishbein has established a tough public persona. In 2014, his questioning of town-funded non-profits led even fellow Republicans to say his queries were bullying. He was unapologetic, telling the Meriden Record Journal,""I'm used to their criticism of me doing their job. Some councilors don't even open up their budget book. Some sleep through meetings. The public elected me to do a job. I attempt to do it at every turn.""

Ben,ocd-person/aec1fe1b-02ac-4802-be69-8714ec0b848e,Catherine A. Osten,Connecticut,"State Senator Cathy Osten was first elected in November 2012 and is now serving her fifth term representing the residents of the 19th state Senatorial District communities of Columbia, Franklin, Hebron, Lebanon, Ledyard, Lisbon, Marlborough, Montville, Norwich and Sprague.

In recent years Cathy has helped write and pass such important legislation as increasing Connecticut’s minimum wage, a sex offender notification bill, the creation of senior safety zones task force, and creating a state version of “Erin’s Law,” which requires that children be educated in schools on sexual abuse in a child-friendly manner, for the purpose of informing and protecting them from sexual abuse.

A 1973 graduate of the Norwich Free Academy, Cathy heeded America’s call for volunteers during the Vietnam era by enlisting in the United States Army. After several months in the U.S., she shipped out to Japan as a translator-interpreter in Chinese Mandarin. After four years of active duty, Sergeant Osten returned to the United States, taking up residence in Norwich and attending Mohegan Community College before beginning her career with the state Department of Correction.

Cathy served in the Correction Department for more than two decades, first as a corrections officer and then as a lieutenant. For 21 years, Cathy experienced first-hand the issues surrounding Connecticut’s prison system, public employees, pension disputes and women’s rights in the workplace. In 2003, following a string of harassment cases against women which stemmed from inside the Connecticut prison system, Cathy joined with other female corrections officers to protest the treatment of women in the workplace. Bringing this fight to the State Capitol, Cathy was able to hold the Correction Department accountable for pervasive sexual harassment.

Understanding the need for more progress in the workplace, Cathy also began working toward the passage of new laws to allow corrections supervisors the right to organize. She was successful, and as president of the Correction Supervisors’ Council of CSEA/SEIU Cathy worked tirelessly to directly represent more than 600 professionals in the Corrections Department.

The mother of one and grandmother of four, Cathy is also an experienced public official; her passionate commitment to her community led her to become Sprague’s first-ever female selectman. In 2011, Cathy was appointed by Governor Malloy to the Two Storm Panel, giving small-town issues statewide attention by highlighting necessary changes by both the utility companies and the state in responding to recent emergencies.

Cathy’s continuous outreach to seniors, her fight for the middle class and her desire for open government and environmental integrity continually demonstrate that her focus is on improving communities.","Cathy Osten, a Democrat, took over a central role in the 2017 budget debate, becoming the co-chair of the Appropriations Committee, a plum assignment in good times and a challenging one when the state is looking to make cuts. 
 
 She played a prominent role in a video that went viral in 2014 as she confronted Tom Foley, the Republican nominee for governor, outside a closing paperboard plant in Sprague, where she is the first selectman. Osten challenged Foley's claim that the company's failure was caused by the policies of Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, drawing Foley into an extended street debate that was seen as damaging to his candidacy.
 
 Osten was a lieutenant in the state Department of Correction who led the union that represented correction supervisors. Osten is a Vietnam-era veteran of the Army, serving in Japan as an interpreter in Chinese Mandarin.
 
 Her sprawling district in eastern Connecticut is largely rural and relatively conservative, but Osten has a liberal voting record with one notable exception: She was one of two Democratic senators to vote against the post-Newtown gun control law. She also has spoken out against the shape increase in gun permit fees proposed by Malloy in 2017.
 
 A strong ally of labor, she voted in 2013 and 2014 to increase the minimum wage, which bumped 45 cents to $9.15 on Jan. 1, 2015 and will reach $10.10 on Jan. 1, 2017.

Jill is devoted to Glastonbury’s well-being and her involvement with Glastonbury’s Town Council since 2011 is a testament. During her time on the Council, Jill assisted businesses interested to expand or relocate. Jill initiated and passed the “Tobacco Free Parks” program in Glastonbury after hearing concerns from parents and coaches that saw people smoking near children at baseball games.

Ben,ocd-person/2c22d680-9e92-423b-a943-20571186c91a,Joan V. Hartley,Connecticut,"State Senator Joan Hartley (D-Waterbury) was elected by an overwhelming margin to represent the 15th State Senate District for a ninth term in November 2016.

After serving for 16 years in the State House of Representatives from the 73rd District, which included serving as Speaker Pro Tempore—the third-highest ranking position in the House—Joan was elected to the State Senate in November 2000.

Joan has a proven record as an effective lawmaker and respected advocate who consistently stands up to represent the best interests of taxpayers and families.

Most recently, Joan received a perfect 100 score from the Connecticut League of Conservation Voters, won a humanitarian award for her work providing urban residents with better access to locally grown fruits and vegetables, welcomed state funding for renovations to Kaynor Technical High School, helped expand transportation options for residents of Greater Waterbury, and secured insurance coverage for women to obtain additional types of breast cancer screenings.

Joan was an author of the state spending cap legislation, voted against the income tax, voted to reduce the gas tax and sales tax, and voted to increase the property tax credit. She also fought HMOs by co-sponsoring legislation to ban “drive through deliveries” and 48-hour mastectomies, prohibiting physician gag orders, establishing an HMO rating system, and working on an inter-state consortium to reduce the cost of prescription drugs.

As a former educator, one of 10 children, and a mother, Joan has always been a strong advocate for education. She wrote the early school readiness legislation which created seats for pre-kindergarten children throughout the state, and worked to provide four-year degree programs at the Waterbury-UConn branch.

Joan lives in Waterbury with her husband, Jim. They have two children, Devin and Brooke.","To appreciate Joan Hartley's conservative Democratic politics is to know that she twice succeeded Republicans to win open seats in the House and State Senate. In the Republican landslide year of 1984, she won her first legislative race, succeeding John G. Rowland, who was elected to Congress.
 
 Hartley's conservatism wears well in her Naugatuck Valley district, but it often has left her on the outs in the State Senate Democratic caucus -- an issue of crucial importance after the 2016 election produced an evenly divided State Senate. Hartley was the only Democrat in the State Senate to join Republicans in blocking the confirmation of Andrew J. McDonald as chief justice of the Supreme Court in 2018.
 
 Hartley has been a frequent defector on fiscal issues. In 2017, she was one of three Democrats in the State Senate to side with Republicans to defeat a Democratic budget proposal. After leaving Democrats one vote short on a veto override during the administration of Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell, she was stripped of her post as co-chair of the Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee in 2009. Another factor was her embarrassing leaders with her objections to a major bonding program for the Connecticut State University system.
 
 She was among the Democrats who voted against the imposition of the state's first broad-based income tax in 1991, the year that independent Lowell P. Weicker Jr. took office as governor amid a fiscal crisis. In 2011, Hartley was no more sympathetic to a new Democratic governor who needed new revenue. She was one of three Democrats in the State Senate to vote against Gov. Dannel P. Malloy's $1.5 billion tax increase.
 
 In 2009, she did vote with Democrats to override Rell's veto of the Sustinet health program, but she disappeared from the chamber the same day on an attempt to override Rell's veto of a health-care pooling bill. Without her vote, the override failed by a vote. In 2008, she voted to increase the minimum wage, but opposed mandating that private employers offer paid sick days.
 
 She was the only Democrat in the State Senate to vote against sweeping reforms in 2005 that created public financing for campaigns and banned contributions from lobbyists and contractors.
 
 More recently, Hartley was the only State Senate Democrat to vote against minimum-wage increase bills in 2013 and 2014. In 2011, she was one of four Democrats to vote against the decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana and one of five to vote against a paid sick days bill that passed by a single vote. In 2012, she was one of two State Senate Democrats to vote against repeal of the death penalty and one of three to vote against the legalization of the production and sale of marijuana for limited medical uses.

 McCarty has been a fiscal conservative, joining her caucus in opposing the 2015 tax increase passed by the General Assembly. McCarty was among the minority of Republicans to help pass a domestic violence bill in 2016 that require gun owners served with temporary restraining orders to surrender their firearms while the TRO is pending.

Ben,ocd-person/240d52a3-33df-495c-b1a0-142cc43f3fce,Ben McGorty,Connecticut,"Representative Ben McGorty was first elected in a special election July 22, 2014, and was most recently re-elected on November 3, 2020.  McGorty represents the people of the 122nd District which includes parts of the towns of Shelton, Stratford and Trumbull.

For the 2021-2023 legislative session, McGorty serves on the legislature’s Public Safety and Banking Committees, as well as the Legislative Regulation Review Committee. He also holds the position of Assistant House Republican Leader, which carries added responsibilities during debate on the House Floor.

McGorty believes that the point of government should be to make our lives better and to make them easier. He has noted that ever-increasing state spending is the biggest obstacle to that. He believes in fiscal responsibility and works as a fiscal watchdog in Hartford.

McGorty is a realtor with William Raveis. He is a member of the Knights of Columbus and is active in local and statewide fire prevention efforts. McGorty is a Lieutenant / Deputy Fire Marshal for the town of Stratford and has served over  twenty-seven years as a volunteer firefighter with the Huntington Fire Department and is also on Shelton’s Board of Fire Commissioners.

His wife, Noreen, is an alderman in Shelton representing the Huntington section of town. She has most recently been a strong proponent of full-day kindergarten. They live in Shelton with their two children, Bennie and Siobhan. They are parishioners of St. Lawrence Church.","McGorty was a newcomer, but not a freshman in 2015. Like the other newcomers, McGorty took the oath of office without having ever cast a vote in the General Assembly. Unlike the others, he arrived having won three elections: a special election on July 22 to fill the unexpired term of the late Larry Miller, then a GOP primary just three weeks later and, ultimately, the general election in November.
 
 His official bio states that he plans to support the ideals of Rep. Miller, supporting ""fair affordable housing laws, a clean environment, and job growth."" One of the first votes he cast was opposing the confirmation of Superior Court Judge Auden Grogins, whose support for the post-Newtown gun-control law as a legislator prompted the NRA to urge her defeat. He voted in 2016 against a law requiring gun owners to surrender their firearms within 24 hours of being served with a temporary restraining order in domestic violence cases.
 
 He had no Democratic opposition in the general elections in 2014 and 2016.

Ben,ocd-person/fc3ba144-870e-4603-b2a4-26d3e80b5c70,Brian Lanoue,Connecticut,"State Representative Brian Lanoue was re-elected to a second term in the General Assembly on November 2, 2020. He proudly serves the 45th District, which includes Griswold, Lisbon, Plainfield, Sterling and Voluntown. Brian is a Co-Chair of the Internship Committee, he also serves on the Committee on Children, Banks and Commerce Committees.

Born and raised in Eastern Connecticut, Brian graduated from the Norwich Free Academy, where he was a well-known host and producer at a commercial radio station, and he received his bachelor’s degree in political science from Eastern Connecticut State University. He took his education a step further by earning his master’s degree in public policy from Southern Connecticut State University where he authored a thesis on the change in public officials’ political positions when they go from one elected office to another.

He is also a former champion powerlifter – one of the youngest athletes ever having won the Men’s Open world title for the deadlift, substance free, at the age of 21.

Brian is a strong believer in Connecticut innovation and entrepreneurship. As the co-owner of a small, family-run business in Griswold, he has experienced the struggles faced by companies operating in our state and understands how legislation passed in Hartford can affect job creators.

The biggest issues currently facing the 45th District include high taxes, a stagnant economy, educational and employment opportunities for young professionals, unpredictable municipal funding from Hartford, issues concerning our Second Amendment right, and the opioid crisis.

Brian addressed each of these issues since his time in the state legislature.

Among Brian’s legislative successes in 2021 was fighting to protect children by requiring background checks for children’s camp employees. After a national news report surfaced detailing abuse at an out of state children’s camp – the absence of background checks in Connecticut prompted Rep. Lanoue to introduce the legislation which he has pushed for since his freshman year in the legislature. Under this new law, PA21-82, now requires employees who work at children’s camps to submit to comprehensive background checks which adds an extra layer of protection for children while away from home. The bill received overwhelming bi-partisan support and was passed by the legislature and signed into law by the governor. Rep. Lanoue is also the lead advocate for the CRISIS Initiative Pilot Program, which brings together state and local law enforcement with mental health professionals to combat the opioid epidemic and mental health disorders. Brian, being the lead advocate on this bill, worked diligently to expand the CRISIS Initiative into Windham County in 2021. The expansion moved CRISIS into the Troop D jurisdiction of the Connecticut State Police and now joins Troop E as the two contiguous regions the program is now being utilized. The expansion of this program is important to the region and adds another resource for police, and those directly in need of the benefits of this program. During the 2022 session, expansion throughout all of Connecticut is being considered.

The Town of Voluntown was upgraded into the Tier one PILOT reimbursement rate from the State of Connecticut following strong advocacy by Rep. Lanoue. In the original language of the legislation, Voluntown was in Tier two of the PILOT Formula, however, the bill was rewritten to specifically address the town. Rep. Lanoue also co-introduced with the Conservative Caucus during the 2021 session, a bill concept that he first introduced in 2019, to help defend gun owners and the Second Amendment by preventing municipalities from imposing more restrictive firearm regulations.

During the 2022 legislative session, Rep. Lanoue proposed a key bill for volunteer first responders, which would deduct personal income tax for stipends paid to volunteer firefighters and volunteer ambulance members. With volunteers being such a vital component to our communities, Rep. Lanoue believes this bill is vital in hopes of giving people more incentive to serve their communities.  H.B. No. 5173, An Act Allowing a Personal Income Tax Deduction for Stipends Paid to Volunteer Firefighters and Volunteer Ambulance Members, is aimed to help with recruiting and retaining volunteer Firefighters and EMS personnel. Rep. Lanoue originally introduced this proposal as a bi-partisan bill during the 2021 legislative session (H.B. 5722). The bill would exempt Connecticut taxes on stipends paid by a municipality to volunteer firefighters and ambulance personnel, up to $1,500 per year.

In March of 2022, Rep. Lanoue testified against legislation that aimed to further violate  law-abiding citizens’  Second Amendment rights that encroached on their constitutional rights to protect themselves and their families. S.B. No. 16, An Act Addressing Gun Violence and Juvenile Crime, was a piece of legislation that had other motives and little to do with curbing juvenile crime. The bill, if passed in its original form, would have required new licensing for retail gun dealers, impose additional restrictions, which included demonstrations and carrying on public transportation.

During the aftermath of Tropical Storm Isaias and the Eversource rate hikes, Brian co-introduced a bill that would establish a task force to study utility companies in Connecticut, specifically to examine the costs and benefits of bringing alternative energy sources into the market.

The 45th General Assembly District’s unique location between two metropolitan hubs offers it a unique opportunity for growth and innovation. As state representative, Brian will continue advocating for regulation reform, tax relief and transportation infrastructure improvements, to attract more businesses to the region, and will fight any anti-business legislation introduced in Hartford. He believes that education must evolve at every level in order to prepare students for the jobs of the 21st Century and will continue to work with his Teen Advisory Council to address the concerns of young people across Connecticut.",,,https://www.facebook.com/RepLanoue,https://www.facebook.com/brian.lanoue.353,,,,,,Republican,45,State House of Representatives,State Representative,Incumbent,Brian,Lanoue,M,Brian.Lanoue@housegop.ct.gov,1/29/82,,brianLanoue61622.jpeg,http://www.cthousegop.com/lanoue/,ftp://ftp.cga.ct.gov/pub/data/LegislatorDatabase.csv,"Legislative Office Building, Room 4200

In 2015, she was one of 18 House members, all Republicans, to oppose the confirmation of Superior Court Judge Auden Grogins, whose support for the Newtown gun law drew the opposition of the NRA to her judicial nomination. A year later, she again sided with gun owners by voting against a bill requiring gun owners to surrender their firearms within 24 hours of being served with a temporary restraining order in domestic violence cases.
 
 She was one of 13 House members to vote against expanding the medical marijuana law to allow cannabis-derived medications to be used on seriously ill children.

She was first elected in 2008 and is currently serving her seventh term in office and her third term as a Deputy Speaker. Rep. Cook serves as a member of the Education, Human Services, Legislative Management, and Public Health Committees.

Representative Cook has been an outspoken supporter for issues involving children and families. In 2010 she worked to reform Connecticut’s domestic violence laws. Representative Cook was recognized as a Children’s Champion by the Connecticut Early Childhood Alliance in 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2018. In 2011 and 2014 she was named the alliance’s Legislator of the Year.

She is also a member of the Medicare Managed Care Committee and the Primary Care Medical Home (PCMH) Subcommittee. PCMH is a program for health care providers and families seeking quality and affordable health care.

Representative Cook has also been a longtime advocate on behalf of seniors and persons with mental health and substance abuse issues. In 2009 she was named the Homecare and Hospice Legislator of the Year. She serves on the advisory council for Prime Time House which assists adults with serious mental illness find employment, education and housing.  

In 2011 Representative Cook was named Legislator of the Year by the Northwest Regional Mental Health Board. Additionally, the Substance Abuse Action Council also recognized her as their Legislator of the Year for her work in 2011 to classify and ban salvia and synthetic marijuana as controlled substances.

In 2013, Representative Cook was named a chair of the Municipal Opportunities Regional Efficiencies (M.O.R.E.) Commission’s Special Education working group which aims to improve special education in the state. She was also named a chair in 2013 to the Restraining Order Task Force. The task force was formed to study policies, procedures and regulations related to the service of restraining orders with an aim to offer opportunities for improvement.  The task force's work is currently being used to guide legislation concerning special education.

Michelle is married to Christopher Cook and has four children: Ryan, Katlyn, Ashlynn, and William.","Michelle Cook, a Democrat, learned in 2014 how competitive her district can be, winning re-election by 52 votes. Her predecessor, Republican Anne L. Ruwett, had won the seat by a single vote in 2002 and was re-elected by only 62 votes in 2006, before losing decisively to Cook.
 
 Living in a swing district has not made Cook politically timid. She voted for Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy's first-year budget and $1.5 billon tax increase, the repeal of the death penalty, decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana, legalization of medical cannabis, two minimum-wage increases, paid sick days, and the gun-control law passed in response to the shooting deaths of 26 children and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. In 2015, she voted for a controversial budget that barely passed on a 73-to-70 vote.
 
 Cook did defect in 2015 on the governor's ""Second Chance Society"" bill, which lowered sentences for simple drug possession as part of a broader effort to reduce incarceration rates. She had been attacked during her 2014 campaign as soft on drug crime over a committee vote on a similar measure.
 
 She was one of the swing-district Democrats targeted for defeat by the Connecticut Business and Industry Association in 2016.

Rep. Piscopo serves as Chief House Republican Whip (the third-highest ranking leadership position within the House Republican caucus). He was reappointed to the leadership position by incoming House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora for the 2021 – 2023 legislative sessions.

As a Chief Whip, Representative Piscopo’s duties involve working with other members of the House Republican caucus to ensure they understand and support important GOP legislative initiatives. Before being named Chief Whip, he served as an Assistant Minority Leader.

Rep. Piscopo was reappointed to the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee as well as the Energy & Technology Committee for the upcoming two-year term. He will also serve on the Environment, Screening, and Legislative Management Committees.

Rep. Piscopo has formerly served on the Appropriations, Executive and Legislative Nominations, General Law, and Public Safety committees as well as the select committees on Housing and Children.

During the 2014 legislative session, Rep. Piscopo worked to get landmark legislation passed which designated the town of Thomaston as an Enterprise Zone, which supports economic growth and development.

Rep. Piscopo also was a co-sponsor of the Open Space Law, which seeks to preserve 21 percent of Connecticut’s land areas as open space for the enjoyment of future generations.

Rep. Piscopo is a 1973 graduate of Thomaston High School. He received a B.A. Degree in 1977 from Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic, majoring in History and Political Science. Rep. Piscopo served as a legislative intern to then-state Sen. Richard C. Bozzuto in 1976.

He is a former member of UNICO of Watertown. He also has done volunteer work for the Thomaston Opera House. He was an early supporter and volunteer in the organization of Thomaston’s recycling program.

Rep. Piscopo is married to Patricia (DeBlois) Piscopo.
","John Piscopo was the national chairman in 2013 of the American Legislative Exchange Council, the small-government and free-market advocacy group known as ALEC, whose agenda has included trying to convince states to withdraw from efforts to control greenhouse gases. The leadership post put the low-key Republican legislator from Connecticut's rural northwest hills at the head of a group controversial for its advocacy of business-written legislation.
 
 In 2013, Piscopo was one of only two House members to vote against a bill requiring state officials to consider rising sea levels when approving funding for sewage treatment plants. Piscopo said the bill legitimized the threats of climate change and sea-level rise, which he believes are overblown. ""If there is a sea level rise, it's minimal. It's really silly to put it in state statutes,"" Piscopo said. ""If you're going to build a new treatment plant, you don't put it on the flood plain. You don't need laws to tell us that.""
 
 He was the only House member to vote in 2012 against a bill aimed at discouraging racial profiling by setting standards for how police must report demographic information on traffic stops. But in 2011 he was one of a handful of Republicans to vote to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana, removing a law that urban legislators said often was used against young blacks. He also voted to legalize the production and sale of cannabis for medical use.
 
 Piscopo, who opposes the intrusion of government into free markets, was one of two legislators in the General Assembly to vote against a bill in 2009 that broadened the coverage that group health plans must give for various forms of autism. He found common ground with Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy on one free-market issue, voting for the governor's proposal to end the state's ban on opening liquor stores on Sunday. 
 
 Piscopo, who voted against the gun-control law passed in response to the shooting deaths of 26 students and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, voted in 2015 against the confirmation of Superior Court Judge Auden Grogins over her support for the Newtown law as a House member in 2013.

Ben,ocd-person/a33a2113-e60b-4000-9dc7-eb58a775d986,Derek Slap,Connecticut,"About Derek:

State Senator Derek Slap was elected in the special election on February 26, 2019 to represent the 98,000 residents of the 5th State Senate District towns of West Hartford, Farmington, Burlington, and the western portion of Bloomfield. He had previously served one term as state representative for the 19th House District, serving constituents in West Hartford, Avon and Bloomfield.

Derek makes his home in West Hartford with his wife, Alex, daughters Maggie and Zoe, and son, Charlie. He is Vice President of Advancement at The Village for Families and Children, working to support families and communities in Greater Hartford. Derek is a lecturer at Sacred heart University and has been a lecturer in Political Science at Yale University and an adjunct professor at Quinnipiac University, Central Connecticut State, Southern Connecticut State and Eastern Connecticut State universities. In 2017 he won an “ARC Angel Award” from ARC for his advocacy on behalf of people with disabilities

Legislative Goals:

As always, one of Derek’s most important goals is enacting an affordable, balanced and sustainable biennial budget that meets the disparate needs and demands voiced by a wide variety of Connecticut residents. Derek works across party lines to identify potential spending cuts and ways to make government more efficient wherever possible.

Derek believes that Connecticut's fiscal health also depends on creating a stronger economy - one that generates more revenue from high-quality jobs. Workforce development, investments in transportation and higher education must also play a role.

Derek believes that the communities he represents enjoy wonderful public schools, and that it is critical, as difficult budget decisions are made in Hartford, that these communities are not unfairly targeted. Derek believes that all children deserve a quality education which provides them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed. Derek also believes public school teachers must be embraced by policymakers as partners in the effort to strengthen and protect our schools.

Additional Legislative Priorities:

This year, Derek is focused on addressing the public health crisis of teen vaping with a multi-pronged approach: increasing the smoking age from 18 to 21; prohibiting the sale of flavored vaping liquids (which are especially popular with teens); and taxing electronic cigarette liquids at the same rate as cigarettes and other tobacco products.

Derek is also committed to fighting age discrimination in the hiring process by seeking to prohibit employers from inquiring about birth or graduation dates on employment applications; the bill has more than two dozen co-sponsors and is supported by the Connecticut AARP.

Recently, Derek has sought to close the wage gap between men and women in Connecticut, arguing that different pay for the same work isn’t only unfair, it’s bad for working families, the economy, and for Connecticut’s overall competitiveness. Derek supports pay equity between men and women to protect employees and prospective employees from gender-based discrimination on wages and compensation.

Derek has also worked to improve transparency and accountability on the Metropolitan District Commission, supporting legislation that adds a non-voting member to the MDC board of directors in the form of a consumer advocate, and requiring the MDC to disclose detailed information about applications for land use, zoning, wetlands and tax abatements before it holds a hearing or acts on the request. Derek has also sought drought protections written into law so bottled water companies cannot continue to pump water from reservoirs during a drought while families are asked to conserve.

Experience and Education:

Derek is the former Chief of Staff for the Senate Democratic Caucus, where he managed a 70-person staff, helped achieve significant budget savings, and worked with citizen activists to address issues such as gun safety, school security and mental health reforms; GMO labeling; and access to high quality pre-k.

Before his tenure as Chief of Staff, Derek was Director of Communications for Senate Democrats for four years. Derek has also been Deputy Chief of Staff/Communications Director for the Secretary of the State, Communications Director for the DeStefano for Governor campaign, and Director of Public Information for the City of New Haven.

You may recognize Derek from TV; he was a news anchor and reporter at NBC Connecticut from 1999 until 2004, and before that worked at TV stations in Florida and at CNN Headline News in Atlanta.

Derek earned his MBA from the UConn School of Business and bachelors’ degrees in Broadcast Journalism and International Relations from Syracuse University, where he graduated Magna cum Laude.","Derek Slap has seen government from all sides. He covered it as a television reporter for NBC 30 from 1999 to 2004, then became a communication aide to John DeStefano, the New Haven mayor and 2006 Democratic nominee for governor. He worked for Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz and did press for the State Senate Democratic majority, eventually becoming the State Senate Democrats' chief of staff under State Senate President Pro Tem Donald Williams.

Ben,ocd-person/b34622c6-66c7-5f9a-822f-55e3f9ac3c73,Joe Courtney,Connecticut,"Congressman Joe Courtney was elected in 2006 to represent the Second Congressional District of Connecticut in the House of Representatives. He serves on the House Armed Services Committee, and House Education and Labor Committee.

Congressman Courtney is the Chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces. According to a review by House Historians Office, Courtney is the first known member from Connecticut to lead a naval oversight panel in the House of Representatives since 1873, when Stephen W. Kellogg of Waterbury served as Chair of the Committee on Expenditures in the Navy Department in the 42nd Congress (1871-1873). Prior to that, Samuel Ingham, a two-term Congressman with connections to Hebron, Jewett City (Griswold) and Essex, served as chair of the Committee on Navy Affairs in the 25th Congress (1837-1839).

In addition, he co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional Shipbuilding Caucus along with Rep. Rob Wittman of Virginia. As a member of the House Education and Labor Committee, he serves on the Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions subcommittee, as well as the Higher Education and Workforce Training subcommittee.

As a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, Congressman Courtney has worked to strengthen our nation's defense by leading the call for increased submarine production. When Courtney arrived in Congress, Electric Boat was facing significant workforce reductions, and, for the first time in 50 years, was not actively designing the next generation of submarine. Because of funding secured by Courtney through his committee work, the men and women of Electric Boat have been building two submarines per year since 2011. In addition, Courtney has secured critical resources for new design and engineering work on the replacement for the OHIO-class submarine, which has added thousands of jobs in southeastern Connecticut. This design and engineering work prompted Electric Boat to expand into the former Pfizer building in New London to accommodate its growing workforce.

Additionally, Congressman Courtney secured over $100 million federal funding outside the President's budget for SUBASE New London. This investment will ensure that New England's largest military installation will have an enduring mission for years to come. In recognition of his work, Courtney was awarded “The Distinguished Public Service Award” from Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, the highest civilian honor the Navy confers.

Since his swearing-in, Congressman Courtney has distinguished himself as a tireless advocate for both our nation's veterans and our men and women in uniform. He successfully fought to expand the Montgomery GI Bill for post-9/11 veterans and their families, and led the fight to extend TRICARE benefits to dependents under age 26. Congressman Courtney also fought and won support for an 18-unit supportive housing facility for homeless and at-risk veterans in Jewett City. He also partnered with Senator John McCain to introduce the Post-9/11 Troops to Teachers Enhancement Act to help members of the military transition into the teaching profession. In recognition of his efforts on behalf of veterans, Congressman Courtney has been awarded the Connecticut National Guard's highest honor, the Meritorious Service Award. He has also earned recognition from veterans organizations, including the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars, which named him Legislator of the Year in 2009.

Having served as a member of the House Agriculture Committee, Congressman Courtney is a vocal proponent for nearly 2,500 farmers across eastern Connecticut. Courtney is the founding co-chairman of the Congressional Dairy Farmers Caucus, and has worked tirelessly to protect family farms from foreclosure and fix the flawed milk pricing system.

Dedicated to preserving our green space and protecting the environment, Courtney introduced and won passage of a law that designated the Eightmile River in Connecticut as a part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Thanks to his efforts, this pristine and scenic watershed will be preserved for generations to come.

Before serving in the House of Representatives, Joe Courtney represented the citizens of Vernon in the Connecticut General Assembly from 1987 to 1994. During this tenure, then state-Rep. Courtney served as House Chairman for both the Public Health and Human Services Committees.

Courtney was recognized in a legislative poll in 1994 by Connecticut Magazine for his bipartisan efforts, and named the ""Most Conscientious"" and the ""Democrat Most Admired by Republicans."" Since he came to Congress, Courtney has received numerous awards from several national organizations including the National Patient Advocate Foundation's 2010 Healthcare Hero award, The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers' Legislator of the Year Award, and the American Farm Bureau's Friend of the Farm Bureau award.

Congressman Courtney is a 1975 graduate of Tufts University in Boston. He earned a law degree from the University of Connecticut School of Law in 1978.

Ben,ocd-person/30e732cb-6e0a-5920-bd7e-8d62ca9b2f7c,Rosa L. DeLauro,Connecticut,"Rosa DeLauro is the Congresswoman from Connecticut’s Third Congressional District, which stretches from the Long Island Sound and New Haven, to the Naugatuck Valley and Waterbury. Rosa serves as the Chair of the House Appropriations Committee and sits on the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, and she is the Chair of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, where she oversees our nation’s investments in education, health, and employment. 

At the core of Rosa’s work is her fight for America’s working families. Rosa believes that we must raise the nation’s minimum wage, give all employees access to paid sick days, allow employees to take paid family and medical leave, and ensure equal pay for equal work. Every day, Rosa fights for legislation that would give all working families an opportunity to succeed.

Rosa believes that our first priority must be to strengthen the economy and create good middle class jobs. She supports tax cuts for working and middle class families, fought to expand the Child Tax Credit to provide tax relief to millions of families, and introduced the Young Child Tax Credit to give families with young children an economic lift.

Rosa has also fought to stop trade agreements that lower wages and ships jobs overseas, while also protecting the rights of employees and unions. She believes that we need to grow our economy by making smart innovative investments in our infrastructure, which is why she introduced legislation to create a National Infrastructure bank.

Rosa is a leader in fighting to improve and expand federal support for child nutrition and for modernizing our food safety system. She believes that the U.S. should have one agency assigned the responsibility for food safety, rather than the 15 different agencies that lay claim to different parts of our food system. Rosa fights against special interests, like tobacco and e-cigarettes, which seek to skirt our public health and safety rules.

As the Chair dealing with appropriations for Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education, Rosa is determined to increase support for education and make college more affordable for more American students and their families. She is also fighting to protect the Affordable Care Act so that all Americans have access to affordable care. Rosa strongly believes in the power of biomedical research and she is working to increase funding so that we can make lifesaving breakthroughs in science and medicine.

Rosa believes that we have a moral obligation to our nation’s veterans and their families, and her concern for these heroes extends to both their physical and mental well-being. Rosa supports a transformation in how the Department of Veterans Affairs is funded, including advanced appropriations for health services, to ensure its fiscal soundness; and she successfully championed legislation to guarantee that troops deploying to combat theaters get the mental health screening they need both before and after deployment, as well as championed legislation that now provides assistance to today’s Post-9/11 veterans choosing to pursue on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs.

Rosa belongs to 62 House caucus groups and is the co-chair of the Baby Caucus, the Long Island Sound Caucus, and the Food Safety Caucus.

Soon after earning degrees from Marymount College and Columbia University, Rosa followed her parents’ footsteps into public service, serving as the first Executive Director of EMILY's List, a national organization dedicated to increasing the number of women in elected office; Executive Director of Countdown '87, the national campaign that successfully stopped U.S. military aid to the Nicaraguan Contras; and as Chief of Staff to U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd. In 1990, Rosa was elected to the House of Representatives, and she has served as the Congresswoman from Connecticut’s Third Congressional District ever since.

Rosa is married to Stanley Greenberg. Their children—Anna, Kathryn, and Jonathan Greenberg—all are grown and pursuing careers. Rosa and Stan have six grandchildren, Rigby, Teo, Sadie, Jasper, Paola and Gus.

Julie has been fighting to make workplaces fairer, safer, and more equitable for men and women for more than 40 years. She began her professional life working in college as a secretary, and quickly discovered that the women in the office were not treated as equals with the male employees.

That experience led Julie to a life of advocacy, organizing workers and building coalitions to achieve pay increases, improve health care, and secure childcare benefits for working Americans. Julie believes there are solutions to all our problems that can be achieved with public policies if you are willing to collaborate, be fair, and be persistent.

Julie was elected Director by the members of the United Auto Workers, Region 9A covering the New England States, a portion of New York and Puerto Rico. Julie was co-chair of the Connecticut Working Families Party, and she served as a delegate or alternate delegate to every Democratic National Convention since 1996.

Julie is committed to the fight for America’s working people by securing better employee health and safety, public pre-kindergarten, tuition-free college, paid family and medical leave, meaningful investment in local infrastructure, protection of the local environment, and promotion of women’s and family issues.

Julie campaigned on a platform of paid family and medical leave, affordable healthcare, and defending a women’s right to choose, and she is passionate on the issues of healthcare, pay equity, and public education.

Ben,ocd-person/c1eb186b-4a6d-4a5f-9afe-a52005a4bc62,Laura M. Devlin,Connecticut,"State Rep. Laura Devlin proudly represents the 134th Assembly District, covering Fairfield and Trumbull. She began her fourth term in January 2021, Devlin serves on the legislature’s committees on, Education, Finance, Revenue and Bonding and Transportation.

Devlin was appointed a Deputy House Republican Leader by House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora in January 2021.

In her three terms Rep. Devlin:

- Aggressively advocated to end the destructive tax policies that are pushing businesses and residents out of Connecticut, to fix and truly fund our state’s transportation system and to ensure clean, open elections.
- Proudly supported significant environmental legislation, which establishes a Long Island Sound Blue Plan to determine the full extent of the Long Island Sound’s resources and a State Constitutional Amendment to protect state-owned open space lands.
- Worked to passed bi-partisan legislation protecting college students and parents by creating a ‘Student Loan Bill of Rights’ and younger students with dyslexia who need additional support and help.

Growing up, Laura lived in the south suburbs of Chicago with her parents, brother and three sisters. Her mother was an elementary school teacher and her father, an entrepreneur. Laura’s father was also a WWII veteran, having landed at Normandy on D-Day and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. He was a strong, proud man and together with my mother, they raised us all to be independent and taught us to work hard, keep our sense of humor, and put family first.

Laura started working at 15 and largely put herself through college, graduating from the University of Illinois in Champaign/Urbana in four years.

Shortly after graduation, Laura started her career and moved to New York City. She wasn’t there long when she was transferred to Oregon, Kentucky, and then back to New York. It was when Laura came back to work in New York City that she chose Fairfield as a place to live because it was the most attractive and affordable community on the Metro North New Haven line.

As a commuter spending three hours a day on a Metro North train, Laura’s time in Fairfield was limited to late evenings and weekends. So when she left her job in New York and stopped her daily commute, she began to get involved in local school and community events as an advocate and volunteer.

In 2011, having become frustrated with the incessant property tax increases and concerned about our Town’s finances, Laura decided it was time to get off the sidelines and do something. She ran for and was elected to Fairfield’s Board of Assessment Appeals and subsequently ran for and was elected to represent District 3 on Fairfield’s RTM, where she also served as a member of the Finance Committee.

Representative Hampton is a non-profit strategist, providing marketing, fundraising, and advocacy services to charitable organizations.","John Hampton is the second consecutive Democrat to win what had been a safe Republican seat in the upscale Farmington Valley suburb of Simsbury. He follows the independent-minded Linda Schofield, one of the Democrats who voted against Gov. Dannel P. Malloy's first-year budget and $1.5 billion tax increase in 2011. 
 
 Hampton was spared in his first term from any tough budget votes, but he was one of 11 House Democrats to vote against the 2015 tax-and-spending plan, which passed on a 73-to-70 vote in the House. Attacked as ""soft on crime"" during his 2014 re-election campaign for a committee vote on a bill that would have shrunk drug-free school zones, Hampton voted against Malloy's ""Second Chance Society"" bill in 2015. It reduced sentences for drug possession, part of an effort to reduce incarceration rates for non-violent crimes.

For the 2021 and 2022 legislative sessions, Rep. Carney was appointed by House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora to serve as the Ranking Member for the Transportation Committee.

Having been a member of the committee for the past six years, the familiarity of responsibilities that come with this appointment is one Rep. Carney knows well, having served in the same capacity from 2017 to 2018 under former Minority Leader Themis Klarides.

In addition, he will also return as a member of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee and the Ranking Member of the Transportation Bonding Subcommittee and will begin his first term on the Education Committee. Rep. Carney was also named an Assistant House Republican Leader and chosen, again, to serve on the House Republican Screening Committee. He serves as the co-chair of the bipartisan Clean Energy Caucus and as a member of the bipartisan Tourism Caucus.

As a life-long resident of the 23rd, he knows first-hand what is important to the residents of this district. Having gone through the Old Saybrook public school system from kindergarten through high school, he knows just how vital the success of our children is as well as the quality of education they receive.

Carney graduated from Brandeis University in 2006 where he received a BA in Political Science and a BA in American Studies with a minor in Film. In addition to the legislature, Carney works in finance at John A Bysko Associates and as a Realtor with Coldwell Banker.

Rep. Carney volunteers his time with many local organizations including serving on The Katharine Hepburn Cultural Arts Center Board of Trustees, as the Treasurer of the Board of Saybrook Senior Housing, as a member of The Rotary Club of Old Saybrook, and as a member of both the Lyme-Old Lyme and Old Saybrook Chambers of Commerce. In addition, he serves as a member of the bipartisan Millennial Action Project, which brings together legislators 45 and under, and the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators. He also serves as an alternate member of the Old Lyme Zoning Board of Appeals.

The various aspects of life, business and community that Carney experienced in Connecticut have given him the means to fully relate to his constituents. The 23rd district is deeply rooted in both his past and present; he is fully vested in this community and seeks to represent these communities with distinction as their voice in Hartford.","Devin Carney, a Republican, was elected with the backing of Marilyn Giuliano, who held the seat for seven terms. He had not held office previously. It quickly has become a safe seat: Carney was unopposed in 2016.
 
 Carney, the grandson of the actor Art Carney, who lived in Westbrook, is a Realtor who has been active in community theater. 
 
 One of his first acts as a legislator was to file a bill that would stop the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection from expanding to rural areas a requirement for separate storm and sewage systems. He says that the requirement exceeds federal environmental rules and would be a financial burden to small towns.

He is a lifelong resident of Eastern Connecticut. Boyd was born in Norwich and grew up in Moosup where he attended public schools. He graduated from Plainfield High School in 1999, earned a BA in History/Social Science at Eastern Connecticut State University and received an MAT with honors from Sacred Heart University. A lifelong educator, Boyd has also been an administrator in both public and private schools at various grade levels. He is currently Assistant Dean of Students, History/Government Teacher, Dorm Parent and baseball coach at the Pomfret School, an independent co-educational boarding prep school founded in 1894.

As a youth, Boyd attained the rank of Eagle Scout. The experience instilled in him the importance of community and public service. In addition to his legislative duties, Boyd is the Emergency Management deputy director and a volunteer firefighter with the Town of Pomfret. Boyd is a lieutenant and president of the Pomfret Volunteer Fire Department and an emergency medical responder with the KB Ambulance Corps. Previously, Boyd served on the Charter Revision Commission for the Town of Plainfield. He has membership in a number of civic organizations including the Windham County 4-H Foundation, Knights of Columbus Council #270, District Vice-Chair for the Connecticut Rivers Council of the Boy Scouts of America and is a member of the Board of Visitors of The Rectory School. Since 2006, he has been director of the June Norcross Webster Scout Reservation in Ashford, the largest youth summer camp in Connecticut.

Boyd is a strong believer in Connecticut’s Quiet Corner. The region has unique rural qualities and is a great place to live, work and play. He strives to be an independent voice for the residents of the 50th District, an area that is often overlooked by state leaders. Representative Boyd looks forward to the challenges ahead and invites you to contact him by email at: pat.boyd@cga.ct.gov.","Pat Boyd's Facebook page describes him as an ""independent Democrat."" Whatever that means, the shrinking House Democratic caucus is happy to have him. He won a Republican seat in 2016, keeping the GOP to a net gain of eight seats in the House.
 
 He represents a district in the Quiet Corner of eastern Connecticut with a curious bit of political history. His predecessor, Mike Alberts, won and lost an election for the same seat on the same day.
 
 Scandal forced the resignation of Rep. Jefferson B. Davis weeks before election day in 2004. On the same ballot, voters had to pick a candidate to fill the remaining two months of Davis's term in a special election and also make their choice for the new term. Democrat Reece Painter won the special election by 11 votes, but Alberts won the full term by 48. Painter was sworn in, but never got the opportunity to cast a vote.
 
 Boyd was one of three Democrats, all from rural eastern districts, to attend a press conference in February 2016 criticizing a proposal by Gov. Dannel P. Malloy to sharply raise gun permit fees. He was the only Democrat in either chamber to vote against a deal the Malloy administration struck with state employee unions to avoid spiking pension costs.",,https://www.facebook.com/RepBoyd,https://www.facebook.com/pat.boyd3,https://www.facebook.com/PatBoydCT,,https://twitter.com/RepPatBoyd,,,Democratic,50,State House of Representatives,State Representative,Incumbent,Patrick,Boyd,M,Pat.Boyd@cga.ct.gov,1/28/81,,patrickBoyd61622.jpeg,http://www.housedems.ct.gov/Boyd,ftp://ftp.cga.ct.gov/pub/data/LegislatorDatabase.csv,"Legislative Office Building, Room 4005

Edwin Vargas, Jr. is a lifelong educator who has been active in political, civil rights, labor, civic and public policy circles. He was born in Brooklyn, N.Y. of Puerto Rican parents. Mr. Vargas was a teacher in the Hartford public schools for 35 years.

Mr. Vargas has served in numerous national leadership roles including: Acting Chair of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) Human and Civil Rights Committee; member of the AFT’s K through 12 Program and Policy Committee; member of the National Democratic Party’s Credentials Committee with the late Gov. Ella Grasso and Public Policy Chair of the Washington, DC-based National Puerto Rican Coalition.

At the local and regional levels Mr. Vargas has served as Lead Teacher at the Hartford Adult School, President of the Greater Hartford Labor Council AFL-CIO, President of the Hartford Federation of Teachers, Vice President of AFT Connecticut and as Chair of the Hartford Democratic Town Committee. He has served on the board of the United Way and is actively involved with the Barry Square NRZ. Vargas has been a consultant and advisor to many governmental, business and nonprofit organizations including serving a five year term as official advisor to the Governor of Puerto Rico on issues affecting the US-based Puerto Rican community.

Most recently Mr. Vargas has served as a commissioner of planning and zoning for the City of Hartford, a position he held for over ten years.

Mr. Vargas is married to fellow educator Sylvia (Carrasquillo) Vargas who has served on the Civilian Police Review Board. They have two adult sons and four grandchildren.

Edwin’s hobbies include playing guitar, writing and playing chess.

Mr. Vargas completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Education and a Master’s degree in Public Administration at the University of Hartford.","Ed Vargas, a former president of the Hartford Federation of Teachers, was a political player and observer in Hartford for more than 30 years, watching as the city's Puerto Rican community achieved a series of political firsts: representation on the City Council and Board of Education, its first seat in the state State House of Representatives, and its first Puerto Rican mayor. In 2008 and again in 2010, Vargas tried to make history by running for the state State Senate, where no Latino had ever served.
 
 Knowing that little worth having in Hartford politics comes without a Democratic primary, Vargas challenged Sen. John Fonfara for the Democratic nomination in the 1st Senatorial District, which covers the city's South End and Wethersfield. In successive election cycles, Vargas gambled that the growing Puerto Rican population of the city's South End, once the domain of Italians and Irish, had reached a tipping point, much as it did years ago in Fonfara's old House district, the 6th. Vargas came within 300 votes in the city, but was crushed in Wethersfield.
 
 Vargas lost another primary in 2011, when he challenged Mayor Pedro Segarra. He changed direction in 2012, challenging Rep. Hector Robles, who had been fired from his job as a Hartford police officer for falsifying time cards. Vargas couldn't beat Fonfara, but the win over Robles gave him a lock on Fonfara's old House seat.
 
 In his first term, Vargas voted in 2013 and 2014 for two minimum-wage bills, the second of which raised the hourly minimum to $9.15 on Jan. 1, 2015, and will bump it to $10.10 two years later. He also voted for the sweeping gun control bill crafted in response to the shooting deaths of 26 children and educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.

Matt has been at the forefront of the efforts to expand access to absentee and early voting in Connecticut. He has also been a fierce voice fighting on behalf of ratepayers to increase accountability and transparency for public utilities, as well as pushing for the sustainable, responsible budgeting that has led to a $3 billion rainy-day fund and multiple credit-rating increases.

Ben,ocd-person/57900db1-ade5-4107-8025-a0c664f41a32,Minnie Gonzalez,Connecticut,"Representative Minnie Gonzalez was born in Adjuntas, Puerto Rico to a family of seven siblings. She graduated from Adjuntas High School and migrated to the United States in 1981.

Her parents, particularly her mother Virginia, were a big influence in her passion for people, relationships and resolution to assist underprivileged citizens. As a single mother to two sons and a daughter, she endured many adversities as a woman and as a minority, but she continued her mother's model and began to get involved helping others to improve their lives, being active in politics and in the community.

Minnie never intended to be a politician, but the community and political partners saw her natural skills and elected her as a Town Committee Member in 1986 and as a legislator for the 3rd district in 1996.

Her passion is representing those who cannot represent themselves. Minnie has worked many different campaigns throughout her political involvement. When she takes up an issue, she is tireless working feverously with no rest until a solution is found. As a State Representative, she has brought millions of dollars to Hartford to improve the quality of life of children and families, mainly in the areas of education, housing and youth services.

Before running for State Representative, she worked as a Special Deputy Sheriff in the West Hartford Superior Court for many years, as well as serving as Assistant Registrar of Voters.

Now in her 13th term, Minnie holds the leadership position of Deputy Speaker and serves on the Appropriations, Public Safety, Legislative Management and Housing Committees.","Guillermina Gonzalez, known as ""Minnie"" to colleagues and constituents, migrated from Puerto Rico to Hartford in 1981 and was elected to the Democratic town committee five years later, beginning a nearly 30-year career practicing politics in one of Connecticut's poorest legislative districts. She has flourished politically, despite occasionally feuding with City Hall. She is a married to a political power broker, Ramon L. Arroyo. 
 
 Gonzalez was one of only 17 House Democrats to vote against a same-sex marriage bill, but she voted with Democrats for much of Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy's first-term agenda, including a $1.5 billion tax increase in 2011. She was absent when the House voted in 2012 to repeal the death penalty and in 2014 when it voted to raise the minimum wage to $10.10, effective Jan. 1, 2017.
 
 Gonzalez has been a critic of the court system and its use of court-appointed lawyers to protect the interests of minor children in divorce cases. In an email that became public in 2015, Gonzalez described Rep. Rosa Rebimbas, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee as""cold with no heart,"" interested in cozying up to judges to ensure future work in family court as a court-appointed guardian of children in contested divorce cases. Gonzalez apologized for mistakenly circulating the email, not for the contents.
 
 She was one of only six legislators to vote against the confirmation of Chase T. Rogers as chief justice of the Supreme Court for a second eight-year term. She objected to Rogers' criticism of Carmen Espinosa, the court's first and only Latina justice, for a strident dissent in a case. Rogers' joined other justices in saying Espinosa had brought ""dishonor"" to the court.
 
 The State Elections Enforcement Commission imposed a $4,500 civil penalty on Gonzalez for four counts of election-law violations, concluding she was ""knowingly present"" while four voters filled out absentee ballots in the town clerk's office in Hartford City Hall in the fall of 2006. She lost her appeal in 2013.",,https://www.facebook.com/pages/Representative-Minnie-Gonzalez/986663904726220,https://www.facebook.com/minnie.gonzalez.7796,,,,,,Democratic,3,State House of Representatives,State Representative,Incumbent,Minnie,Gonzalez,F,Minnie.Gonzalez@cga.ct.gov,1/4/50,,minnieGonzalez61622.png,http://www.housedems.ct.gov/Gonzalez,ftp://ftp.cga.ct.gov/pub/data/LegislatorDatabase.csv,"Legislative Office Building, Room 4031

Ben,ocd-person/77713b68-e8ef-455e-80a6-1614488fb71a,Mae Flexer,Connecticut,"State Senator Mae Flexer was sworn-in to the Connecticut State Senate to represent the 29th District of Brooklyn, Canterbury, Killingly, Mansfield, Putnam, Scotland, Thompson and Windham in January 2015. From 2008 to 2014 Mae served three terms in the Connecticut House of Representatives serving the 44th Assembly District towns of Killingly and Plainfield.

In 2017, Mae was appointed by Senate President Pro Tempore Martin M. Looney to serve as Deputy President Pro Tempore and Federal Relations Liaison. She serves as Senate Chair of the legislature’s Government Administration & Elections committee and as Senate Vice-Chair of the Higher Education & Employment Advancement committee. She also serves as a member of the Appropriations, Judiciary, and Education committees.

As the daughter of an Irish immigrant and a disabled Vietnam Veteran, Mae grew up in a family that didn't have much in the way of financial resources, but through hard work, grit and the support of various government programs has achieved what most families dream for. Her upbringing, which included relying on food stamps, Medicaid, subsidized housing and Pell grants, has greatly shaped her priorities during her public service career in the Connecticut General Assembly. At a time when Connecticut is cutting more and more valuable state programs, Mae has stood against cuts to programs and benefits like the ones that once moved her own family out of poverty and gave her and her sister the chance to be the first in their family to go to college.

As Connecticut’s youngest female state Senator, she has fought diligently for issues that particularly effect women, fighting for economic fairness and justice through efforts to create the first in the nation state paid sick day law and paid family leave while also fighting to increase the minimum wage. She has worked especially hard to improve and strengthen Connecticut's efforts to address domestic and sexual violence including being the author of trend setting laws that mandate that colleges and universities provide services to sexual assault, stalking and domestic violence victims and requiring the annual reporting of those incidents to the legislature. In 2019, she wrote and facilitated Senate and House passage of Senate Bill 3, the “Time’s Up Act,” which increases certain sexual harassment penalties, extend the time limits people have to file criminal charges for sexual assault from five years to twenty years, and require more employer-sponsored sexual harassment training.

She also authored a law requiring higher education institutions to use affirmative consent or ""yes means yes"" as the standard when investigating offenses against survivors of assault. She advocated for and secured resources to improve Connecticut's response to domestic violence by providing 24/7 staffing at domestic violence shelters, establishing a pilot GPS monitoring program for offenders to protect victim safety, and allowing judges to place financial requirements in orders of protection to ensure offenders continue to pay the bills when removed from the home. She has championed laws that mandate the retrieval of firearms from domestic violence offenders upon the issuance of a temporary restraining order despite fierce opposition from the NRA. Her work against domestic violence and sexual assault has received national and statewide recognition.

In 2018, Mae led Connecticut's successful effort to join the National Popular Vote Compact, and worked diligently with CT Students for a Dream for 5 years to finally pass a law allowing undocumented students access to financial aid at the state's public colleges and universities.

Protecting the character of a community is also a top priority for Mae. This year, in an effort to decrease the rate of tobacco use in our state, she co-wrote and facilitated Senate passage of H.B. 7200, An Act Prohibiting the Sale of Cigarettes, Tobacco Products, Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems and Vapor Products to Persons Under Age Twenty-One. The law raises the point of sale for tobacco products from 18 to 21, with penalties ranging from fines to mandated education and suspension of business licenses for violators. It passed both the House and the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support.

Mae has also long been a champion for seniors and veterans in our state. She led the state legislature in approving a new law ensuring that the driver’s licenses of members of the military will not expire while they are on active duty and stationed out-of-state. She’s fought to increase veteran education benefits, expand state tax credits for veteran-owned businesses, and streamline the application process for veterans looking for work. Mae has worked to make sure our state’s seniors could stay in their homes by taking on big utility companies to reduce fees, and has led the fight to strengthen protections against abuse and neglect of seniors, and to expand support for caregivers.

Additionally, as the chair of the Human Services subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, Mae was proud to argue against the inclusion of an asset test in the Governor’s 2019-2020 budget recommendations. She knew that it would hurt some of the most vulnerable people in our state, and the committee voted to pass the legislature’s budget recommendations without an asset test, maintaining the strong Medicare Savings Program we have today.

An alumnus of Killingly High School, Mae earned a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of Connecticut and a degree from Quinebaug Valley Community College. Mae currently works as the inaugural executive director of Emerge Connecticut, the state affiliate of Emerge America, an organization that recruits, trains and mentors Democratic women to run for office.","Mae Flexer, a Democrat, literally came of age in politics. She joined the Killingly Democratic town committee at age 18 and was elected its chair at 23. She won a House seat at 28 and entered the State Senate at age 34.
 
 She interrupted her graduate studies at the University of Connecticut in 2008 to run for the legislature, where she had been an aide to State Senate President Pro Tem Donald E. Williams Jr., whose seat she won in 2014 after he declined to seek re-election. 
 
 As a new House member, Flexer was named to lead a task force on domestic violence, helping to produce a package of legislation, including a bill that provided funding for the Judicial Department to use GPS to track high-risk domestic violence offenders.
 
 Flexer voted as a House member in 2013 for the gun-control bill passed in response to the Sandy Hook school shooting, a vote that made her a target for outraged gun owners in 2014. While her district includes a half-dozen rural communities where gun owners were thought to hold sway, it also includes Mansfield, the home of the University of Connecticut, and urban Willimantic.
 
 She is one seven freshman senators in the 2015-2016 term, three of whom served in the House: Flexer and another Democrat, Tim Larson of East Hartford, and Republican Tony Hwang of Fairfield. She was targeted for defeat by an independent expenditure group in 2016, when she faced her 2014 opponent in a rematch. She won with 55 percent of the vote, helped by the solid bloc of Democratic voters in Mansfield and Windham.

Additionally, Senator Murphy has worked in partnership with local city and town leaders to rehabilitate former brownfield and factory sites so that they can be developed into new community spaces and businesses.

Prior to his election to the U.S. Senate, Murphy served Connecticut's Fifth Congressional District for three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. During his time in the House, Murphy worked to improve access to housing for homeless veterans, foster job creation and advocate for affordable healthcare for all Americans.
